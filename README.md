Beginning Graph Database Programming

To read the filename with a .cql extension you will need:
1. Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Once Visual Studio Code has been installed, go to the extensions tab (the four squares), 
search for 'cypher' extension and install it. You should now be able to read the CQL commands.
